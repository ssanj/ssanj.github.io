            <p>My friend <a href="http://ryandrake.com">Ryan</a> can’t stop sending me cool articles to read! Thanks Ryan! :) In this one <a href="https://blog.growth.supply/the-methods-for-superhuman-productivity-de4452af7cfb">Robin Sharma talks about how to achived Superhuman productivity</a>. Robin says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in The Age of Dramatic Distraction. Many shiny toys to chase every waking moment yet so few of those pursuits create real value and grow a life brilliantly lived.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Too many of us are overscheduled, overconnected and overstimulated by all the noise, interruptions and complexity of current society.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost of this way of operating? You’ll arrive at the last hour of your final day and realize you spent your highest potential on your lowest leverage activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 20/20/20 formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way you start your day powerfully shapes how productively you live it. Reserve the first 60 minutes for personal preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start your day with some exercise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Spartan warriors said: “Sweat more in training and you’ll bleed less at war.” Spend your first 20 minutes in intense exercise. Sweating releases BDNF, a brain chemical that actually grows neural connections. Working out also releases dopamine (the neurotransmitter of motivation) and serotonin, which makes you feel happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next review your annual plan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the next “20 minute pocket”, review your annual plan and reflect deeply on your quarterly goals. Clarity precedes mastery and this practice will deepen your focus through the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next inspire yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invest the final 20 minutes of this morning routine on learning (i.e., read autobiographies of great humans or listen to a leadership podcast or download the lessons of yesterday into &gt; your journal).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn how to recover effectively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good research confirms that what makes the best athletes the best in the world was not what they did in their sport but how effectively they recovered. For example, it was the rituals that star tennis players did in between points that made them stars. What made the Russian weightlifters so undefeatable was their “work-rest ratios”</p>
