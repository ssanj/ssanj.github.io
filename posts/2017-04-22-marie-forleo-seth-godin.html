<li><p>Your life doesn’t get more sensational when you have more followers on twitter. That’s not what you ought to be keeping score of.</p></li>
<li><p>Does this interaction leave behind a trail that I am proud of? Does the interaction make me glad that I did it and want to do it again?</p></li>
<li><p>There is no prize for originality. You should steal other peoples’ ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose what matters which aligns with who you want to be.</p></li>
<li><p>On blogging - If day after day, week after week you leave this trail behind of thoughtful examination of your world, you can’t help but get better at what you seek to do.</p></li>
<li><p>You gain trust and permission to talk to people by showing up in a way that you’d want someone to show up for you.</p></li>
<li><p>When you take scarcity away everything changes (Eg. The Internet with music, tv, books).</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionally seek out things you maybe wrong about (Find a topic you might be sure about and take an opposite stance about why you might be wrong).</p></li>
<li><p>How to be more productive per minute - Have an instinct to ship; not to be perfect, to polish, to justify that you are not shipping.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people hesitate to ship, not because they are not ready, but because they are afraid.</p></li>
<li><p>Press the buzzer before you are sure you know the answer. You have to be good at buzzer management.</p></li>
<li><p>What am I not going to do so that I can do something else (Opportunity cost).</p></li>
<li><p>We have to acknowledge we have finite resources, finite time, finite connection. How will we use them to produce outcomes we are proud of?</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be a wondering generality. Be a meaningful specific.</p>

Unless you’re 4-years-old, if you loose at Monopoly I think you realise it is not personal. It was a game. You didn’t get the rolls you needed, maybe you made a couple of strategy mistakes, but you can play again tomorrow. It’s not about you, don’t have a tantrum, don’t turn the board over and don’t beat yourself up. Why don’t we take that adult mindset and apply it to other things?

<li><p>Isn’t our goal to be better at the game?</p></li>
<li><p>We can be mindful, we can be present, we can breathe and say “That’s interesting”. And that answer is so much better than freaking out over what every small failure means.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t act like failure is fatal. It isn’t.</p>

<li><p>Raising Free Range Kids means teaching kids to fail at solving interesting problems, because that’s the only way you ever get good at solving interesting problems.</p></li>
<li><p>How to measure your success - Will people miss you if you are gone?</p></li>
<li><p>Permission is the privilege of being looked forward to and being missed if you were gone.</p>

Our goal isn’t to touch everyone. Our goal is to change someone; just one person. If you get good at that, do 5, then do 100. But stop worrying about everyone. Everyone doesn’t matter.
