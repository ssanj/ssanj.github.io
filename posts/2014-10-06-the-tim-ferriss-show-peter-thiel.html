            <p>Some interesting ideas from <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog">The Tim Ferriss Show’s</a> interview with Peter Thiel:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Capitalism and Competition are not synonyms but antonyms. Eg. the Restaurant business in SFO is incredibly competitive but not capitalistic because no one makes any money from it.</li>
<li>You don’t have to wait to start something. If you have a 10 year plan to do something with your life you should ask yourself why you can’t do it in 6 months.</li>
<li>Failure is massively overrated. Most businesses fail for more than one reason. When a business fails you sometimes don’t learn anything at all because there were too many factors involved in that failure.</li>
<li>The death of every business is a tragedy.</li>
<li>Successful founders are relentless. Everyday they do more and get better at it.</li>
<li>Stay away from trends as you will have many competitors. Prefer missions. Work on unique problems people are not solving elsewhere.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why are you doing something. Make sure you like the answer.</li>
<li>What do people agree merely by convention and what is the truth?</li>
<li>We never want to use convention as a shortcut for truth. We need to always ask “is this true?”</li>
<li>“Tell me something that is true that very few people agree with you on.”</li>
<li>Always try to think for yourself and break through conventions.</li>
<li>I try to have conversations with smart people every day.</li>
