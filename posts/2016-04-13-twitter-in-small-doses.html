            <p>I’ve been guilty of checking Twitter almost habitually at every free moment. It’s like I expect something new and interesting to be happen every five minutes - it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Recently I tried limiting my Twitter exposure to set times during the day: once in the morning, once at lunch and once after work. I found that this really reduced the mental stress of constantly processing mostly useless information on Twitter. It also helped me to focus more on the few tweets I did care about and respond to them thoughtfully, instead of replying with smart-arse comments. Another benefit was that <a href="http://sanj.ink/posts/2014-09-14-do-less-achieve-more.html">I was able to concentrate deeper on the actual work</a> I had to do because I wasn’t constantly context-switching with Twitter.</p>
<p>It became clear that nothing happening on Twitter is all that important. This again made it much easier to stay way from it.</p>
<p>If you are habitually checking Twitter or some other form of social media, try and give yourself a schedule of when you can check for updates. You’ll soon realise that while these mediums maybe useful sometimes, more often than not, they are a complete waste of time.</p>
