            <p>Something I’ve started doing recently is contributing to open source projects on Github. The following is an overview of the workflow needed for submitting your contributions to a project of your choice.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fork the project you are interested in on github. The fork provides you with a copy of the project in your own repository. At this point the two projects are not linked.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you perform a</p>
<pre class="command"><code>git remote -v</code></pre>
<p>You’ll see that only your forked version of the git repository is listed.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Add the original project as a remote repository. We do this so we can rebase onto it later if need be.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="command"><code>git add remote upstream git://project_you_forked.git</code></pre>
<p>If you look up remotes</p>
<pre class="command"><code>git remote -v</code></pre>
<p>You’ll see the upstream repository listed as well.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Perform a fetch to retrieve the index for the upstream project.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="command"><code>git fetch upstream</code></pre>
<p>This will update your local index with the upstream branches.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Create a branch from master for your feature</li>
</ol>
<pre class="command"><code>git checkout -b your_feature</code></pre>
<p>If you do a diff between your current HEAD and the upstream/master</p>
<pre class="command"><code>git log upstream/master..HEAD</code></pre>
<p>you should have no differences. This is your base line. All changes from this point will become part of your pull request.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Implement your feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a pull request on your fork of the project through Github. There should be a button indicating that your feature changes can be created in a pull request.</p></li>
<li><p>After you create the pull request, the maintainer of the upstream project will get a notification of your feature modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>The simple scenario is where your changes are accepted and the upstream project merges in your changes to the upstream/master and you are done at this point. You can safely delete your fork and your feature branch.</p></li>
<li><p>The usual scenario is where other pull requests have been merged into upstream/master while you were coding away on your feature. The upstream maintainer may ask you to rebase onto upstream/master to make the merge easy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can do this with</p>
<pre class="command"><code>git fetch upstream/master</code></pre>
<p>to retrieve the latest upstream changes into your index. Then you git rebase</p>
<pre class="command"><code>git rebase -i upstream/master</code></pre>
<p>This will open up the rebase text editor and allow you to choose which commits to apply or fix any issues that arise.</p>
<p>Once you are done rebasing locally it’s time to push up your changes. All your changes will be part of the pull request you created for this feature.</p>
<p>Since you have rebased with upstream/master, your remote/feature and your local feature branch have diverged - meaning they don’t share the same ancestral commit they once did.</p>
<p>You can overcome this in many ways, but the simplest would be to do a force push.</p>
<h3 id="force-push">Force Push</h3>
<pre class="command"><code>git push origin feature --force-with-lease</code></pre>
<p>The –force-with-lease ensures that you can’t force push changes if someone else has committed to your remote branch, which would lead to lost commits.</p>
<p>This will update your remote/feature branch and your pull request. This will allow the upstream maintainer to merge in your changes with minimal effort and you’re done.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-separate-branch">Create a separate branch</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to force push your changes, as it is generally not recommended, then you can create a new branch from your rebased changes.</p>
<p>After you rebase, create a new branch from the rebase:</p>
<p>git checkout -b your_new_branch</p>
<p>Run any tests that your repository may have.</p>
<p>Push the new branch to your remote</p>
<pre class="command"><code>git push -u origin your_new_branch</code></pre>
<p>Create a new pull request. Add comment in the new request and mention the old pull request number. This will help the upstream maintainer to link the two pull requests.
.
Eg. if the old pull request was #54 then add in a comment to the new pull request:</p>
<p>Creating this PR to replace #54, with a rebase.</p>
<p>Now The old PR (#54) references the new one. You can now safely close the old PR with a comment about the new PR.</p>
<p>And you should be done!</p>
<p>Happy contributing.</p>
