            <p>Ideas from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Obstacle-Is-Way-Timeless/dp/1591846358">The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday</a></p>
<p>“Obstacles are actually opportunities to test ourselves, try new things, and, ultimately, to triumph.” - Ryan Holiday</p>
<h3 id="perception">Perception</h3>
<ul>
<li>When faced with insurmountable obstacles we should try to:
<ol type="1">
<li>Be objective.</li>
<li>Control emotions and keep an even keel.</li>
<li>Choose to see the good in the situation.</li>
<li>Ignore what disturbs and limits others.</li>
<li>Focus on what can be controlled.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We decide what we make of each and every situation.</li>
<li>The observing eye sees simply what is there. The perceiving eye sees more than what is there.</li>
<li>Take your situation and pretend it is not happening to you. Pretend it is not important and that it doesn’t matter.</li>
<li>Is your perspective truly giving you <em>perspective</em> or is it actually causing you problems?</li>
<li>Focus on what you can change.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The trick to forget about the big picture is to look at everything close up” - Chuck Palahniuk</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the moment not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead.</li>
<li>Obstacles illuminate new options.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="action">Action</h3>
<ul>
<li>Doing new things invariably means obstacles. A new path is by definition uncleared.</li>
<li>It’s okay to be discouraged. It’s not okay to quit.</li>
<li>Settle in for the long haul and then try each and every possibility, and you’ll get there.</li>
</ul>
<p>“What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first steps to something better.” - Wendell Phillips</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons come hard only if you are deaf to them.</li>
<li>Failure shows us the way by showing us what isn’t the way.</li>
<li>Excellence is a matter of steps. Excelling at this one, then that one, and then the one after that.</li>
<li>Even mammoth tasks become a series of component parts.</li>
<li>Take your time, don’t rush. Some problems are harder than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Whatever is rightly done, however humble, is noble” - Sir Henry Royce</p>
<p>“The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out. There are brambles in the path? Then go around. That’s all you need to know.” - Marcus Aurelius</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the best with what you’ve got.</li>
</ul>
<p>“I don’t care if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice.” - Deng Xiaoping</p>
<ul>
<li>Start thinking like a radical pragmatist.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Whoever cannot seek the unforeseen sees nothing, for the known way is an impasse” - Heraclitus</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the longest way around is the shortest way home.</li>
</ul>
<p>“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.” - Rahm Emanuel</p>
<p>“In the meantime, cling tooth and nail to the following rule:
not to give into adversity, not to trust prosperity, and always take full note
of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases” - Seneca</p>
<ul>
<li>We must be willing to roll the dice and lose. Prepare at the end of the day for none of it to work.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="will">Will</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always try to:
<ol type="1">
<li>Prepare yourself for more difficult times.</li>
<li>Accept what you are unable to change.</li>
<li>Manage your expectations.</li>
<li>Persevere.</li>
<li>Learn to love your fate and what happens to you.</li>
<li>Protect your inner self and retreat into yourself.</li>
<li>Submit to a greater, larger cause.</li>
<li>Remind yourself of your mortality.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Have a premortem for your projects. Look at what could and will go wrong before you start.</li>
<li>You must never lower yourself to becoming a person you don’t like.</li>
<li>Don’t inflate your role and your importance.</li>
</ul>
