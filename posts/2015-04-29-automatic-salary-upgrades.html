            <p>One of the many reasons people leave a workplace is to gain a higher salary. Employers, never really review salaries relative to their current market rate. Employers see this as investment in their bottom line: “Don’t pay employees more than you have to”. Employees, usually get a small raise to placate them until the next review with a list of “reasons” as to why the increment wasn’t higher. The whole review-mediocre-salary-increment cycle then repeats in the next review period.</p>
<p>Employees, at the back of their minds know, they are are worth more. They feel undervalued. Cheated. They start looking for a new job. The money saved by not paying employees what they are worth is soon going to cost the company many times more than they “saved”.</p>
<p>When a great employee leaves, the company loses a lot. A lot of money. A lot of time. A lot of energy. A lot of credibility. Other employees might start to wonder: “Why did Sam leave for another job?” “Does he know something we don’t?” “Should we be looking for jobs too?”</p>
<p>So how can a company retain its great staff?</p>
<p>What if employees didn’t have to ask for a raise?</p>
<p>What if a company noticed employee contributions?</p>
<p>What if employees didn’t have to worry about their salary at all?</p>
<p>What if the company automatically upgraded employee salaries to the current market rate?</p>
<p>What kind of workplace would that be?</p>
<p>As direct result employees would:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Feel more valued.</li>
<li>Stop stressing out about salary.</li>
<li>Stop stressing out about salary reviews and “asking” for a raise.</li>
<li>Stop making themselves “look” important and contribute instead.</li>
<li>Stop looking jobs to get more money.</li>
<li>Give their full attention to the tasks at hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wouldn’t that be nice?</p>
