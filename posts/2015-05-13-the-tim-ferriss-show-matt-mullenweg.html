            <p>Some interesting ideas from <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/09/matt-mullenweg">The Tim Ferriss Show’s interview with Matt Mullenweg</a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open source was the most important idea he was exposed to in his lifetime.</li>
<li>Open source is a bill of rights for software. The four freedoms of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can use it for any purpose.</li>
<li>You can deconstruct the software to understand how it works.</li>
<li>You can modify it.</li>
<li>You can distribute your modifications.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The (famous) 5 minute installation of Wordpress. It was not famous, but became so. It did something totally different to the big players in the market.</li>
<li>Philosophy and political science help you to think about systems and incentives.</li>
<li>How do you self-enable people?</li>
<li>If you do X today, what does that result in tomorrow, a year from now, ten years from now?</li>
<li>The dog chasing the car Metaphor. What does the dog do if it catches the car?</li>
<li>Plan for success. What is the natural conclusion of your idea if it’s really successful?</li>
<li>Gives the Wordpress community a nudge to go in directions they would not go by themselves.</li>
<li>Uses Dvorak as an alternative keyboard.</li>
<li>Automattic does not send email. They use <a href="http://p2theme.com">P2</a>. Threads help follow a conversation. How does a new employee follow ten years of email?</li>
<li>Keep information public. Trust people.</li>
<li><a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> is “consumer grade” - it doesn’t suck like most enterprise software.</li>
<li>Rig the game so you can win. Eg. Doing one push-up a day.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
<p>Unschedule more of your life. Create space. Read a lot more to give yourself creative inspiration or the ideas for the next big thing.</p>
</div>
<ol start="15" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The hardest thing is spending time on the most important things in life.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality">Bike shedding</a> - Spending a lot of time on discussions on relatively unimportant but simple issues, while neglecting the more important but complex issues.</li>
<li>Playing Saxophone taught him how to breathe, how to be on stage in front of people, how to listen and respond, how to co-compose on the fly, how to learn new things and how to practice deliberately.</li>
<li>If you only practise the things you are good at you’ll never get better at the things you are not good at.</li>
<li>Business Judo: what can we do that google can’t do?</li>
<li>Advice to his twenty year-old-self: Slow down to go further. Build foundations. Build things that last long term.</li>
<li>Take time for yourself, meditate, focuss on the present moment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
<p>Everyone is interesting! If you’re bored, the problem is with you not the other person. It’s all about figuring out what someone is into or what they are passionate about.</p>
