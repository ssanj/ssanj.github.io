            <p>I had seen him selling the <a href="http://www.thebigissue.org.au">Big Issue</a> by Central station. He had a beard and wore a singlet of some description. He was in shorts. I had never purchased the Big Issue myself but always thought I should buy one - someday.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of my mind I recalled that the Big Issue was sold by homeless and disadvantaged people. It had never occurred to me that he might have been cold in this weather and didn’t have a warm jacket. I guess I was too busy worrying about my own “big” issues; being self-centred as most of us are these days.</p>
<p>Recently while walking out of the train station I noticed a lady chatting with the Big Issue-selling bearded gentleman. He had a nice warm, long coat on. He had a big smile on his face. She was talking to him about how she had thought about him and brought him the coat. She was all enthusiastic. Two lives changed for the better.</p>
<p>This scene totally blew me away. When you help someone you not only help that person, but you also enrich your own life. Your benevolence also affects all who witness it. I want to see more of this in the world. Please, can I see some more?</p>
<p>I have since donated a swag through <a href="http://swags.org.au">Swags for homeless</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swags for Homeless is a not-for-profit charity working to provide emergency relief Backpack Beds to every homeless person turned away from shelter.</p>
