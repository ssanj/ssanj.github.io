            <p>Ideas from the book <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">Zero to one by Peter Thiel</a></p>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Horizontal - Copying things that work. Going from 1 to x. Eg. You take one typewriter and then build another hundred copies.</li>
<li>Vertical - Doing new things. Going from 0 to 1. Eg. You take a typewriter and build a word processor.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="startup-thinking">Startup Thinking</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new company’s most important strength is new thinking.</li>
<li>A startup has to question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.</li>
<li>A lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature but he will never create an entire industry on his own.</li>
<li>Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get things done. You also need to stay small enough so you actually can.</li>
<li>A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monopolies">Monopolies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competition and Capitalism are opposites.</li>
<li>Monopolies exaggerate the power of their (nonexistent) competition to avoid scrutiny.</li>
<li>Entrepreneur’s exaggerate how powerful they are and understate the competition. “We are in a league of our own”.</li>
<li>The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. You also have to discount future cash flow to its present worth due to depreciation.</li>
<li>Ask yourself “will this business be around a decade from now?”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-build-a-monopoly">How to Build a Monopoly</h3>
<h4 id="proprietary-technology">1. Proprietary Technology</h4>
<ul>
<li>A proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension.</li>
<li>The easiest way to be 10 times better is to invent something new. Where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="network-effects">2. Network Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it. Eg. Twitter.</li>
<li>To reap the benefits of network effects, your product must be useful to its very first users, when the network is naturally small.</li>
<li>You must start will specially small markets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="economies-of-scale">3. Economies of Scale</h4>
<ul>
<li>The cost of creating another copy of your software should be close to zero.</li>
<li>A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="branding">4. Branding</h4>
<ul>
<li>A technology company can’t be built on brand alone.</li>
<li>Begin with substance then build your brand.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-choose-a-market">How to Choose A Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small.</li>
<li>It’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one.</li>
<li>Choose a small group of particular people, concentrated together and served by few or no competition.</li>
<li>It’s a red flag to talk about 1% of a very large market. You’ll have to fight too many competitors to get that 1%.</li>
<li>Once you create and dominate a niche market, gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Eg. Amazon wanted to dominate all online retail but started with books.</li>
<li>Don’t disrupt. Avoid competition as much as possible</li>
<li>“You must study the endgame before anything else” - Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-power-law">The Power Law</h3>
<ul>
<li>A small handful of companies radically outperform all others.</li>
<li>The differences between companies dwarf differences in roles within companies.</li>
<li>Before you focus relentlessly on something you’re good at, think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.</li>
<li>For startups this means you should not necessarily start your own company, even if you are extraordinarily talented. It might be better to join a successful company when it’s growing fast.</li>
<li>You could have 100% equity if you fully fund your own company. If it fails you will have a 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google will give you millions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secrets">Secrets</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are two kinds of secrets:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Secrets about nature - Undiscovered aspects of the physical world.</li>
<li>Secrets about people - Things people don’t know about themselves or things people want to hide from you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What secrets is nature not telling you?</li>
<li>What secrets are people not telling you?</li>
<li>You can’t find secrets without looking for them.</li>
<li>The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking for them.</li>
<li>A great company is a conspiracy to change the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selling">Selling</h3>
<p>Your company needs to sell more than its product. You must sell your company to employees and investors.</p>
<h3 id="computers-are-a-tool">Computers are a Tool</h3>
<p>“How can computers help humans solve hard problems?”</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jobs saw that you can change the world through planning; not by listening to focus group feedback or copying others’ success.</li>
<li>Long-term planning is often undervalued in our indefinite short-term world - If you see the future as random why plan?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="questions-every-business-must-answer">7 Questions Every Business must Answer</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?</li>
<li>Is now the right time to start your particular business?</li>
<li>Are you starting with a big share of a small market?</li>
<li>Do you have the right team?</li>
<li>Do you have a way to create and deliver your product?</li>
<li>Will your market position be defensible 10 to 20 years into the future?</li>
<li>Have you identified a unique opportunity others don’t see?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on making new things.</li>
<li>Make the future not just different but better.</li>
<li>Think for yourself.</li>
<li>Look at the world with fresh perspective similar to the ancients.</li>
