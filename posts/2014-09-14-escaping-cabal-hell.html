            <p>Cabal. What a nightmare. Right? That was the view I had on it until recently. I had just upgraded to GCH 7.8.3 and almost none of my projects built with Cabal anymore. Hell. So I decided it was time to learn to use Cabal properly. In my research I came across the extremely useful <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/Survival">Cabal Survival Guide</a> which had many great pointers. So have a read of it if your Cabal project fails to build.</p>
<p><a href="http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2013-08-20-Cabal-sandbox.html">Cabal Sandboxes</a> are also a great way to isolate your project’s dependencies from the rest of your system and drastically reduce the number of dependency issues you will have with Cabal.</p>
<p>And if you haven’t read it, have a read of the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/">Cabal User Guide</a> to understand how things work. Read the User Manual? Are you crazy?</p>
<p>Some other unusual errors have missing header files (.h). I came across one of these <a href="http://sanj.ink/posts/2014-10-23-cabal-fails-to-install-pcre-light-linux.html">errors</a> and the solution was to install the necessary library on the OS. So basically any Haskell wrappers around OS libraries would (obviously) need the correct versions of the library installed.</p>
<p>Hopefully a basic understanding of Cabal usage plus some solutions to common problems will lead you to Cabal heaven. Too soon? ;)</p>
