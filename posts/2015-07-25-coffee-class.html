            <p>Four of us - three work colleagues and myself - attended a coffee “class” at our favourite coffee shop <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coffeeanthology">Coffee Anthology</a> last Friday. We had been trying to organise it for a while and it all finally came together.</p>
<p>The class lasted for around three and a half hours. During this time we learned many interesting details about coffee and how to make it. Some of the topics we covered were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The different types of coffee beans.
<ol type="1">
<li>How the amount of roasting affects the taste of the beans.</li>
<li>How to identity a good roast from a under/over roast.</li>
<li>The texture and smell of a variety of beans.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Tasting coffees that had been made under a variety of extraction speeds. (too slow, too fast, just right)</li>
<li>Tasting coffees that had been made with a variety of extraction pressures. (too little, too much, just right)</li>
<li>Tasting coffees that had been made with a variety milk temperatures. (too low, too high and just right)</li>
<li>A lot of great hands-on Latte art.</li>
<li>Tasting filtered coffee.</li>
</ol>
<p>And more… but that’s mostly what I remember.</p>
<p>We ended up paying $450 for the four of us. $112.50 each. What a bargain.</p>
