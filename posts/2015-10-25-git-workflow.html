            <p>There are quite a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/">few</a> git workflows out there. <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model">Vincent Driessen</a> came up with the first Gitflow that I followed for my own projects. Other companies like Github use a <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">simpler version</a> to that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything in the master branch is deployable.</li>
<li>To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes).</li>
<li>Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server.</li>
<li>When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request.</li>
<li>After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master.</li>
<li>Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with the variety of flows linked to above, we are experimenting with yet another variant at my current workplace. I prefer the simplicity of the Gihub flow but we had additional requirements like deploying to staging that it does not seem to support. Here are the steps we used:</p>
<ul>
<li>To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of develop (ie: new-oauth2-scopes).</li>
<li>Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server. Committing to the server will run an automated build and test suite.</li>
<li>When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request against develop.</li>
<li>At this point your PR will be reviewed by one or more developers. You make any changes suggested and push again to verify that your reviewers are happy with the changes.</li>
<li>Once your PR is merged into develop, another automated build and test suite will run. Once it passes, your build is deployed to a staging environment for additional scripted or manual testing.</li>
<li>When the changes of your branch need to be pushed to production, a PR is created between develop and master.</li>
<li>Someone will review all the changes from develop that will be merged into master. There could be many so it’s a good idea to have at least a glance at everything that will hit master. Once the PR is merged into master it will run an automated build and test suite.</li>
<li>Once the master build passes we create a Github release with release notes and a tag.</li>
<li>When we are ready to deploy the changes from master to production we manually kick off a build to create our production deployment.</li>
</ul>
