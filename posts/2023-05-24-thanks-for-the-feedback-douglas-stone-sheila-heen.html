<ul>
<li>Our need for acceptance and our need to improve are both affected by feedback. Often these are competing needs.</li>
<li>Actively seeking out feedback in a work environment can lead to significant positive gains if handled properly.</li>
<li>Our inherent triggers are barriers to us hearing feedback, accepting it and learning from it.</li>
<li>Try to ensure that you understand feedback before accepting or rejecting it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ensure you know which type of feedback is being given.</li>
<li>Explicitly ask for the type that you are after to avoid confusion.</li>
<li>If you’re giving feedback check with the receiver that the feedback is being received in the type requested.</li>
<li>Clarify what the feedback means without jumping into conclusions See <a href="#additional-prompts">Additional Prompts</a></li>
<li>Feedback is subjective to the person giving it. It’s shaped by their experiences and temperament. Ask for examples. Find out what “good” looks like in the future.</li>
<li>All feedback is Data + Judgement call (based on their experience of the world) -&gt; Label -&gt; Future consequences (as they see it)</li>

<ul>
<li>We focus on our intentions in a situation. Others focus on the effect our actions have on them in the same situation.</li>
<li>We blame the situation for our failure. Others blame our character for the failure.</li>
<li>We downplay our emotions in a situation while others experience them in an amplified way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blind-spots">Blind Spots</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can get honest feedback from someone that dislikes you or with someone you don’t get along with.</li>
<li>Ask the people you have the hardest time with to give you feedback.</li>
<li>Discuss separate topics separately. Identify the different streams and call them out. Focus on one stream at a time.</li>
<li>Each of us only sees one side of the problem.</li>
<li>Each of us is involved in the problem to different degrees.</li>
<li>Notice if you are reacting to the other person.</li>
<li>The three issues of a relationship system:
<ol type="1">
<li>Differences - Are the difference between us causing problems?</li>
<li>Roles - Is this a result of the roles we play?</li>
<li>Processes - Are processes, politics, physical environment etc making the problem worse?</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>when it comes to stories about yourself, you get what you Google</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Look for the good or look for the bad. You’ll always find something to answer you query.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>How you perceive feedback is based on three things:
<ul>
<li>Baseline - how happy or sad are we generally</li>
<li>Swing - How far off the base line are you pushed by positive or negative events</li>
<li>Sustain and Recovery - How long are you pushed away from your baseline due to a positive or negative event?</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>We can extend the positive feelings we get from positive feedback by recalling it regularly from memory.</li>
<li>Feelings exaggerate feedback.</li>
<li>Figure out how you typically react to feedback (do you get defensive or appreciative?)</li>
<li>Check in with yourself during a feedback session to see how you are doing.</li>
<li>Notice how you embellish the story.</li>
<li>Things to keep in mind:
<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong> - The present doesn’t change the past and <strong>may</strong> determine the future.</li>
<li><strong>Specificity</strong> - Being bad at one thing does not make you bad at everything. Just because you’re bad at something now, doesn’t mean you’ll always be bad at it.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong> - Just because one person doesn’t like us doesn’t mean that everyone doesn’t like us. People’s views change over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Our predictions of the future are often wrong.</li>
<li>Imagine the feedback is not about you but of someone else. What advice would you give that person on how to respond?</li>
<li>Ask: “How significant this feedback would be X years from now?”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tragedy + Time = Comedy</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>See your life as an amusing play. Don’t take everything so seriously.</li>
<li>You can’t control what other people think of you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="second-score">Second Score</h3>
<p>The first score is the feedback itself. The second is the score you give yourself for handling the feedback, and your subsequent improvements (if any).</p>
<h3 id="setting-boundaries">Setting Boundaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set limits on feedback. You can dictate the time, frequency or say no to the way it’s delivered.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Unhelpful feedback is useless: relentless unhelpful feedback is destructive</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the person doesn’t care about the effect of feedback on you or is not listening, then there is something wrong with the dynamic.</li>
<li>Let the person giving you feedback know the kind of feedback you do want.</li>
<li>Use <code>And</code> instead of <code>But</code>. <code>And</code> signifies that two things are true not just one.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been afraid to talk to you about this <em>and</em> it’s important to me to be honest with you</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_curve">J curve</a>: A J curve is any of a variety of J-shaped diagrams where a curve initially falls, then steeply rises above the starting point.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Things might get worse before they get better.</p>

<ul>
<li>Try on different feedback for a while (eg. A couple of weeks). If it’s not working discard it.</li>
<li>Make it easy for people to give you feedback. Don’t demand that it be delivered in a specific way.</li>
<li>Feedback should be specific doing your current job more effectively.</li>
<li>Have a balanced view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s wrong with this feedback?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s right about this feedback?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You don’t always have to accept feedback.</li>
<li>Encourage people to think about the feedback and their second score.</li>
<li>Ask people to coach you on how to give better feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-prompts">Additional Prompts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you give me an example?</li>
<li>Can you help me understand your feedback?</li>
<li>What did that mean to you?</li>
<li>What do you see that’s getting in my own way?</li>
<li>How did that impact you?</li>
<li>What’s most upsetting to you and why?</li>
<li>What could I do to help me improve?</li>
<li>What am I contributing to the problem between us?</li>
<li>What does this mean for me?</li>
<li>What will happen next?</li>
<li>What is expected of me?</li>
<li>Given where I am now, what should I do next?</li>
<li>I wonder if this feedback sits in my blind spot?</li>
<li>Have I heard this feedback before?</li>
<li>What will happen if I follow this feedback?</li>
<li>Is this about helping me grow and improve?</li>
<li>Is this something about our relationship dynamics?</li>
<li>What do I feel?</li>
<li>What’s the story I am telling?</li>
<li>What’s the actual feedback?</li>
<li>What is the feedback not about?</li>
