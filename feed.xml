    <title>Ignore Everybody</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Ideas from the chapter “Ignore Everybody” from the book <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/ie">Ignore Everybody And 39 other Keys to Creativity</a> by Hugh MacLeod.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The more original your idea is, the less good advice other people will be able to give you.</li>
<li>You don’t know if your idea is any good the moment it is created. Neither does anyone else.</li>
<li>A big idea will change you.</li>
<li>Good ideas alter the power balance in relationships. That is why good ideas are initially resisted.</li>
<li>Good ideas come with a heavy burden, which is why so few people execute them.</li>

    <title>Honing your Creative Practice</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-04-20-honing-your-creative-practice.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Ideas from the chapter “Honing your creative practice” from the book <a href="http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2">Manage Your Day-To-Day</a> with Seth Godin.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lots and lots of people are creative when they feel like it, but you are only going to become a professional if you do it when you don’t feel like it. And that emotional waiver is why this is your work and not your hobby.</li>
<li>Practice is a big part of being creative.</li>
<li>Being creative means you have to sell your ideas. Selling is part of it because if you don’t sell it, there is no art.</li>
<li>It’s much easier to whine and sabotage yourself and blame the client, the system, and the economy. This is what you hide from - the noise in your head that says you are not good enough, that says it is not perfect, that says it could have been better.</li>

    <title>Why Your Company should have a Creed</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-04-19-why-your-company-should-have-a-creed.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a> is a company founded by Matt Mullenweg. He also developed <a href="https://en-au.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> ten years ago. He talks of the notion of a “company creed” which codifies the culture and values of a company. Here’s the Autommatic creed (as of September 19th, 2011):</p>
<div class="quote">
I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.
</div>
<p>Matt further says that:</p>
<div class="quote">
If you’re building a startup or any sort of organisation, take a few moments to reflect on the qualities that the people you most enjoy working with embody and the user experience of new people joining your organisation, from the offer letter to their first day.
</div>
<p>Finally Matt has an innovative way of introducing the company’s creed to new hires:</p>
<div class="quote">
Finally, as a hack to introduce new folks to our culture, we put a beta “Automattic Creed”, basically a statement of things important to us, written in the first person. We put it after the legal gobbledygook and before the signature area; if you chose to accept the offer, you’d sign your name next to the values before starting work. This seemed like a powerful statement and might affect people’s perceptions in the same way that putting signatures at the top of forms increases honesty.

    <title>How to run a Company with (almost) no Rules</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-04-12-how-to-run-a-company-with-almost-no-rules.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Some interesting ideas from Ricardo Semler’s Ted Talk: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ricardo_semler_radical_wisdom_for_a_company_a_school_a_life">How to run a company with (almost) no rules</a>:</p>
<div class="quote">
What if your job didn’t control your life?
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start working through your bucket list now. Don’t wait until you are in dire straights to do so.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
Instead of going mountain climbing when you’re 82, why don’t you do it next week?
</div>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Employees are given freedom over what they ware, when they work and how they behave.</li>
<li>Employees can buy back one day of the week for 10% of their salary.</li>
<li>Employees are contracted for a piece of work and given autonomy.</li>
<li>All leaders in the company must be interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every 6 months everyone gets anonymously reviewed as a leader. If existing leaders are graded poorly they are replaced.</li>
<li>People are allowed to set their own salaries given three pieces of information:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How much money people make inside the company.</li>
<li>The market rate for a similar position in a similar company.</li>
<li>Whether the company can afford to give them the salary they want.</li>
</ul>
<div class="quote">
How do we design, how do we organise, for more wisdom?
</div>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If an employee finishes all their work early they get to take the rest of the week off.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
We said things like, we don’t want to see your expense report, we don’t want to know how many holidays you’re taking, we don’t want to know where you work.
</div>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Information is open and democratic. The board has two vacant seats with the equal voting rights. Any two employees from the company can show up and vote on company issues. This keeps the board honest. Eg. Cleaners voting on the direction of the company.</li>
<li>We know nothing about the important things in life:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Love</li>
<li>Death</li>
<li>Our purpose</li>
</ul>
<div class="quote">
If you say “I have to give back”, then you took too much.
</div>
<ol start="10" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Free yourself from past achievements. Give yourself the freedom to start something new.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
We’ve all learned how to work from home on Sunday night, but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon.
</div>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ask yourself: “Why am I doing this?”.</li>

    <title>Laying the Groundwork for an Effective Routine</title>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To create something truly worthwhile, you need to make room for the work you consider important. This means delaying or not doing the work you consider unimportant.</li>
<li>To create something great you need:
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Thought</li>
<li>Craft</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do creative work first. Do reactive work second.</li>
<li>Do your creative work when you have the most energy during the day.</li>
<li>Use triggers like using the same tools, listening to the same music or working in the same environment each day to enter your creative zone.</li>
<li>Have a very small daily TODO list. Most things can wait until tomorrow.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>First of all, hire only the best people for your company. If you can’t find good people, then use your money elsewhere.</p>
<p>Second, hire people who can take your company to where you want it to be in the future not just to sustain it where it is now.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Calculated Risks have a Critical Mass</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-04-09-calculated-risks-have-a-critical-mass.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We all need to work very fast these days. Bugs in production are costing us money on an hourly basis. We may have a gaping security hole. We don’t have the capacity to service all our current clients. We have to solve these problems ASAP. Or do we?</p>
<p>Technical debt is the main way these unplanned, extremely “urgent” features, changes or fixes get into production. We over estimate our capabilities constantly. We think we are taking “calculated” risks. In reality we are not doing any calculations. Our understanding of the current workings of the system is usually off. Way off. We have forgotten about the fix Joe did last week. Or the new configuration that is in place for special customers. We need to be <a href="http://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys">five whysing</a> ourselves about “Why does this happen?”.</p>
<p>You can only continue to incur technical debt for so long. If you keep incurring technical debt on a regular basis, there will come a tipping point where your system will become massively unstable. It will become exponentially harder to fix bugs and add new features. Developers will “give up” on the code base because they don’t want to work on a foundation of hacks. Quality will slip. Your product will fail. Your company will go out of business.</p>
<p>All that sounds a bit dramatic. If you keep accumulating technical debt, your system will be foreclosed. It’s not “if” but “when”.</p>
<p>So how can you work with technical debt and still have a stable system? How can you fix critical issues and not piss off all your developers and operations people? Here are some ideas:</p>
<h1 id="investigate-your-risks">Investigate your risks</h1>
<p>Actually spend a good chunk of time thinking about how the system works. Work in a pair if possible and look through the source code, configuration and architecture. Run your risk assessment past members of the team from different technical and non-technical areas. No one person should be making the risk call - specially not a non-technical person. If the risk is too great, think of alternative ways of solving your problem. Could you get an extension from the client? Can we bare with the issues we have now? Can we do nothing? What will it cost us?</p>
<h1 id="have-a-repayment-plan">Have a repayment plan</h1>
<p>Make a plan to pay off the technical debt after a certain release, feature/fix or by a certain date. Have an upper limit on the amount of debt you can accrue. Do not incur more debt after this limit has been reached. Sacrifice new features for stability through repayments.</p>
<h1 id="make-the-smallest-change-possible">Make the smallest change possible</h1>
<p>If you do decide to take on some technical debt, try to make it as small as possible. This is not the time to change the core architecture or make other sweeping changes. Make the change as small as possible. Make sure all your unit and integration tests pass. If they don’t, make the smallest change possible to get them to pass or take them out of the build.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s more important to have a suit of working tests that you can rely on over just ignoring failing tests. If you start ignoring test failures you will never have full confidence in your test suite as some of them are known to fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="document-your-debts">Document your debts</h1>
<p>Document the reasons for incurring the debt directly in the code that is affected by it. This can be done using comments or TODOs that you can come back to later. After you incur technical debt, add it to a debt register of some kind. This could be a wiki page, card wall or even a bunch of red postits on a wall or whiteboard. This will be a constant reminder of the debt you have already incurred. It also will help you to pay back this debt ASAP and prevent you from taking unnecessary new debt. As the wiki page or the wall grows, you know you are in trouble.</p>
<h1 id="pay-off-your-debts">Pay off your debts</h1>
<p>Completely rewrite any code hacks documented in your debt registry. Reintroduce all excluded tests. Make them pass. Add more tests. Refactor. Win. :)</p>]]></description>

    <title>Workplaces are a Snapshot in Time</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-03-29-workplaces-are-a-snapshot-in-time.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Work places are like a snapshot in time. The people, the culture, the technology etc are in a constant state of flux. Some people leave. Others join. Technology is replaced frequently. Methodologies change. Fortunes are made and lost.</p>
<p>I had the recent good fortune to go back to one of my previous work places. I had worked there six years prior and had left swearing never to return. I had since heard good things and had returned. The place had almost completely changed. Sure, there were pockets of “old” behaviour lying around but for the most part it was a completely different organisation. Different people, technologies, methodologies, philosophies - you name it.</p>
<p>Whenever you work somewhere try and soak it all in. Chances are that the exact combination of things around you will never be the same. Enjoy the uniqueness of the present.</p>]]></description>
