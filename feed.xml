    <title>Make Time for some Awe</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-28-make-time-for-some-awe.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Awe is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, fear, etc., produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A commentary about why we need more awe in our lives from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/why-do-we-experience-awe.html">New York Times</a> via <a href="http://ma.tt">Ma.tt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that awe deprivation has had a hand in a broad societal shift that has been widely observed over the past 50 years: People have become more individualistic, more self-focused, more materialistic and less connected to others. To reverse this trend, we suggest that people insist on experiencing more everyday awe, to actively seek out what gives them goose bumps, be it in looking at trees, night skies, patterns of wind on water or the quotidian nobility of others — the teenage punk who gives up his seat on public transportation, the young child who explores the world in a state of wonder, the person who presses on against all odds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/quotidian">Quotidian</a> is such a cool word. :)</p>
<p>Through various social experiments they found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants experiencing awe, more so than those participants experiencing emotions like pride or amusement, cooperated more, shared more resources and sacrificed more for others — all of which are behaviours necessary for our collective life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their thoughts on how awe works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One answer is that awe imbues people with a different sense of themselves, one that is smaller, more humble and part of something larger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s make time for some awe in our lives. :)</p>]]></description>

    <title>Scala Compilation Speed on MacBook Pros</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-24-scala-compilation-speed-on-mbp.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sanj.ink/posts/2015-05-21-between-apple-and-despair.html">After deciding to take the plunge and buy the new MBP 15“</a>, I thought a little benchmarking would be a nice confirmation that my “upgrade” made sense. Most times I use my laptop for Scala development and writing my blog. I thought I’d run some tests around the Scala compilation times for some well-known projects.</p>
<p>Here’s how I tested each project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Git cloned the project.</li>
<li>Connected my laptop to the mains (to ensure no energy saving was sacrificing performance).</li>
<li><p>Downloaded the world with:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>sbt clean compile</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Ran a clean compilation four times and took the average, min and max times:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>sbt &quot;set offline := true&quot; clean compile</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Scala open source projects used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">Scalaz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spray/spray">Spray</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless">Shapeless</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Model A =&gt; 2010 15&quot; MBP 2.4GHZ i5, 8GB, SSD.</li>
<li>Model B =&gt; 2014 15&quot; MBP 2.2GHZ i7, 16GB, SSD. (<em>This is not the 2015 model but is pretty close to it</em>.)</li>
</ul>
All compilation times are in seconds (s).

    <title>Between an Apple and Despair</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-21-between-apple-and-despair.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The new MBP 15&quot; was just announced and I am #disappointed. No new processor. Just the same one from last year with higher clock rates. No USB type C connectors. No form-factor changes. No “innovation”</p>
<p>I had waited patiently for the last six months for this update. Talk about underwhelmed. I did what any underwhelmed person would do - look for alternatives.</p>
<p>I did find some interesting alternatives in <a href="http://www.dell.com/au/p/alienware-15/pd">Alienware</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/19/msi-gt72-dominator-review">Msi</a>. They were also not constrained by Apple’s release cycles. They could in theory release laptops with the newest processors as soon as they were released. I wanted to run Linux on any laptop I buy. When I did some research around the two options, I came across troubling issues like: “can’t boot to Ubuntu” or “doesn’t have drivers for the wireless card”.</p>
<p>Then it hit me. There was a good reason why I had moved to Apple instead of using my own screamingly fast Linux laptop. I didn’t want to waste my time trying to get the hardware to work with the software. I wanted things to “Just work” - (c)Apple. The Apple, drivers were all there. The software was good-ish. More importantly I knew that if something as basic as a wireless card driver was broken that it would be fixed pretty quick. Not so with Linux and custom hardware.</p>
<p>With Apple I was purchasing the hardware and software, along with an implicit promise that they would work together.</p>
<p>The lack of proper support for Linux from hardware manufacturers is really surprising. Most programmers I know use either Linux or MacOSX. Surely we make up a large percentage of the laptop-buying population? Are Windows developers and gamers the core laptop-buying demographic? Or is it corporate types that love Microsoft Office and other Windows shackles?</p>
<p>If I were given another alternative to using Apple, I would definitely use it. The troubling fact is there are none - if you don’t want to use Windows.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to take the plunge and upgrade my 2010 MBP to the latest 2015 “update”. A friend said I should wait for the new processors coming later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“you are going to be kicking yourself when the new ones come out though”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would mean maybe another six months waiting for an update that would hopefully be worthy of a year of waiting. My only regret is that I hadn’t upgraded six months ago. I would have had a hearty laugh when the current update came out.</p>
<p>And then there’s more interesting news with Intel’s plans for Skylake “leaked” by some so and so. <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/22/rumor-intel-prepping-next-gen-skylake-chips-for-august-debut-may-curtail-broadwell-sales">Skylake is supposed to drop in August</a> and with it bring in a 15% speed increase plus usher in a revolutionary wireless peripheral era. So even if, Intel deliver Skylake in August - and that’s a big “if”, given that they are so behind on Broadwell promises there’s also this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intel’s launching Skylake-S early to take advantage of the buffer zone while taking their time with Skylake-K so that any bugs that hinder clock speed have been ironed out. That would involve solving the TDP problem and eventually rolling out some very impressive unlocked processors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://wccftech.com/intels-broadwell-skylake-uarch-transition-big-prescott-conroe">Read more about that at wccftech</a></p>
<p>So do I want to buy a processor where Intel is trying to iron out its bugs? No thanks. This indicates that the faster Skylake, less “buggy” processors will only start showing up maybe mid 2016. Another reason to buy a MBP now!</p>
<p>So my wait is over. I’m taking the plunge. I hope not to kick myself in August! :)</p>]]></description>

    <title>Know When to Rest</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-17-know-when-to-rest.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s great to a have a routine. It’s great to have goals. It’s great to work consistently day in and day out.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just don’t feel like you have the motivation. Your work feels like a chore. Or that you’ve done all you want to do for the moment. You may have lost your “flow” - where your craft just pours out of you without any provocation.</p>
<p>When this happens, take a break from your routine. You can never produce your best work when your heart is not in it.</p>
<p>Take a day, a week or even a month off. You could even build it into your routine. This time off will help you to revitalise your creative spirit and come back refreshed and renewed to do awesome work.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to break your routine when you need to.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Why I don&apos;t use a Coffee Loyalty Card</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-14-why-i-dont-use-a-loyalty-card.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Loyalty cards. You can’t buy anything these days without being prompted for one. By name they seem to imply some kind of loyalty which I doubt exists.</p>
<p>I have my coffee at an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coffeeanthology">awesome coffee shop</a> everyday. I don’t keep going back because I can get one free coffee for every nine I buy. Quite the contrary. I find getting your loyalty card stamped or lining up your phone with some app to register your purchase quite annoying.</p>
<p>I go there because the coffee is good and it is reasonably priced. If the coffee stops being good or if the price rises exponentially, no amount of “loyalty” is going to get me to go back there.</p>
<p>Also, I like knowing that when I buy my tenth coffee, the owners of the coffee shop, a small business, don’t have to lose some of their profits just to keep me “loyal”.</p>]]></description>
