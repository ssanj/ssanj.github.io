    <title>Real People Still Exist</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-07-25-real-people-still-exist.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I was on my way to work on a crowded train. I was in one of those carriages where people sit in rows on either side as opposed to next to each other.</p>
<p>An old lady, maybe in her sixties, was making her way through the train. She suddenly trips and falls face-first onto the floor. She lands on the floor next to the lady sitting by me. We all get a fright.</p>
<p>In an instant, everyone put down their phones and unplugged their headphones. Many rushed to her aid and lifted her off the ground. It must have been an awful experience for her. Someone gave her a seat. She started laughing hysterically for about ten seconds. I saw a young lady give her a smile and a nod as if to say “you’re going to be okay.”</p>
<p>While what happened was horrible, it gave me hope. Hiding behind all those digital devices were people. Bona fide human beings who still cared.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Developing Software is not Easy</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who tells you different doesn’t know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>You might hear something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a simple fix. All you have to do is do X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things always seem simpler to people who do not understand the implications of the changes they want you to make.</p>
<p>Or you might hear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s conceptually simple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s something that’s conceptually simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take man from Earth and put him on the Moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You just want to move a person from one place to another. What’s the problem? Simple right?</p>]]></description>

    <title>Coffee Class</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-07-25-coffee-class.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Four of us - three work colleagues and myself - attended a coffee “class” at our favourite coffee shop <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coffeeanthology">Coffee Anthology</a> last Friday. We had been trying to organise it for a while and it all finally came together.</p>
<p>The class lasted for around three and a half hours. During this time we learned many interesting details about coffee and how to make it. Some of the topics we covered were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The different types of coffee beans.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How the amount of roasting affects the taste of the beans.</li>
<li>How to identity a good roast from a under/over roast.</li>
<li>The texture and smell of a variety of beans.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Tasting coffees that had been made under a variety of extraction speeds. (too slow, too fast, just right)</li>
<li>Tasting coffees that had been made with a variety of extraction pressures. (too little, too much, just right)</li>
<li>Tasting coffees that had been made with a variety milk temperatures. (too low, too high and just right)</li>
<li>A lot of great hands-on Latte art.</li>
<li>Tasting filtered coffee.</li>
</ol>
<p>And more… but that’s mostly what I remember.</p>
<p>We ended up paying $450 for the four of us. $112.50 each. What a bargain.</p>
<p>If this sounds like fun contact Adam at Coffee Anthology.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Using Sublime for Scala Development</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-07-15-using-sublime-for-scala-development.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Writing Scala code with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">Intellij</a> has become quite annoying. Intellij is definitely the tool of choice for Java coding. With all that “enterprisey” brew-ha going on you need all the help you can get.</p>
<p>Lately, Intellij has started to get bloated. And unreliable. It’s always indexing things at the most inconvenient times. This is specially the case when you open a project and hope to start working. It also has quite a few bugs and crashes frequently. It’s also in competition with sbt for its lock file. Forget about running sbt and Intellij at the same time.</p>
<p>I’ve started playing around with using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> as a Scala IDE. Initially I did not know how to start work. I had become so dependent on Intellij to tell me everything about anything that I had no clue how to proceed. I couldn’t CTRL + Click. I couldn’t CMD + SPACE. I was powerless.</p>
<p>After persisting for a few hours and after installing a bunch of useful plugins I was getting somewhere.</p>
<p>I found that it was much easier to focus on the code. Intellij was not constantly prompting me for stuff, or indexing or crashing or doing something else distracting. I ended up writing simpler code as I had to use less tooling. The whole experience was much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>In a subsequent article I’ll get into the details on how I customised my Sublime environment to make it useful for Scala development. If in the meantime you are considering leaving Intellij for Sublime, Vim, Atom or some other editor, definitely go for it. You will not regret it.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Stop Complaining on Twitter</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-07-15-stop-complaining-on-twitter.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It almost seems like Twitter was built for complaining. You often see people ranting and raging about some inanity. I recently had one of those “ranty” moments and almost tweeted about.</p>
<p>This time I chose to do something different. I chose to disguise my rant in a (bad) joke. Safari on my iPhone was crashing. A lot. Instead of ranting, here’s what I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Safari on the iPhone can’t stop crashing. I’m tempted to let Google record all my conversations so that I can browse the Internet. #apple</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s not that funny, but at least it ties together two recent events. It also made me use my brain and made me smile. :)</p>
<p>The next time you want to rant or complain about something on twitter, consider writing something humorous instead.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Three Hundred Percent Better</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-07-12-three-hundred-percent-better.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I was recently having a conversation with a co-worker. He mentioned that he had come into a work place where someone who had recently left was “three hundred percent better” than everyone else there. He went on to say that people had compared themselves with this “genius” and then felt horrible about themselves. They thought they were no longer good enough to do anything important. They thought they knew nothing. They were “broken”.</p>
<p>Working with someone three hundred percent better than myself would be a dream come true. I would join a workplace just to be around such an individual. My thinking is that even if I improve on myself by ten percent by being around this genius, it would be an awesome win. How did this guy or gal become so good? How do they think about things? How can I learn to be more like them?</p>
<p>The real clincher was that I had worked with this individual at a previous workplace. He had put me on a path to learning that I would not be on otherwise. I feel deeply indebted to him. I have improved by much more than ten percent by being around him. By learning from him I was forced to put away any arrogant notions that I knew everything. I found it refreshing to be around someone who was that good at what they did. It made me want to become an improved version of myself. I still have much to learn and I am happy with that. I try to improve in small increments everyday. I actively seek out other “geniuses” to learn from.</p>
<p>What’s fascinating is that different people reacted to the same stimulus in different ways. For some, it was the end of all they held dear, for others it was the road to mastery they always dreamt of.</p>]]></description>

    <title>How to Install Yosemite on a New SSD</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-07-12-how-to-instal-yosemite-on-a-new-ssd.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>After I got my new MBP, I decided to sell my old 2010 MBP. I wanted to keep all my existing data on my old laptop, so I decided to swap out its SSD and to put in a brand new one.</p>
<p>The process of installing Yosemite on the new SSD was not as straightforward as I would have liked. I thought I’d blog about it to help anyone else who needed to do the same.</p>
<p>Basically I was trying to sell a 2010 MBP with a new SSD, with Yosemite installed but not configured.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download Yosemite installation from the App store. It might complain that you already have it installed but download it anyway. It will be downloaded to <strong>/Applications</strong> and be named <strong>Install OS X Yosemite.app</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201372">Create a bootable image from the Yosemite installer</a> on a USB stick larger than 6GB. In a terminal run:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="terminal scrollx"><code>sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app</code></pre>
<p><em>where MyVolume is the name of your USB stick. Change this to match the name of your USB stick.</em></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Physically install SSD into the target laptop.</li>
<li>Insert the Yosemite USB stick into the target laptop and power up. (<em>This might take a while.</em>)</li>
<li>When the menu finally turns up, choose <strong>Disk Utility</strong> and format the SSD as <strong>Mac OS Extended (Journaled)</strong> with a unique name.</li>
<li>Once complete, exit from <strong>Disk Utility</strong> and return the main menu.</li>
<li>Choose to <strong>Install OS X</strong> on the formatted SSD.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts until Yosemite is installed.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F82ThP-6jeA">Here’s link to a video on how to physically install the SSD as well as run the software installation</a>.</p>]]></description>

    <title>We need Guts</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Not in a zombie apocalypse-kind of way. Seth Godin in <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/06/the-fruitless-search-for-extraordinary-people-willing-to-take-ordinary-jobs.html">The fruitless search for extraordinary people willing to take ordinary jobs</a> says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building an extraordinary organization takes guts. The guts to trust the team, to treat them with respect and to go to ridiculous lengths to find, keep and nurture people who care enough to make a difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also says that amazing people need to be nurtured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s unreasonable to expect that you’ll develop amazing people when you don’t give them room to change, grow and fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t agree more.</p>]]></description>
