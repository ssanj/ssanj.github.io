    <title>Scala Compiler Speed on MacBookPros</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-24-scala-compiler-speed-on-mbp.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sanj.ink/posts/2015-05-21-between-apple-and-despair.html">After deciding to take the plunge and buy the new MBP 15“</a>, I thought a little benchmarking would be a nice confirmation that my “upgrade” made sense. Most times I use my laptop for Scala development and writing my blog. I thought I’d run some tests around the Scala compilation times for some well-known projects.</p>
<p>Here’s how I tested each project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>git clone the project.</li>
<li>Connected my laptop to the mains (to ensure no energy saving was sacrificing performance).</li>
<li>run sbt clean compile (this is to download the world)</li>
<li>run sbt “set offline := true” clean compile (run four times and then take the average, min and max)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scala open source projects used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">Scalaz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spray/spray">Spray</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless">Shapeless</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Model A =&gt; 2010 15&quot; MBP 2.4GHZ i5, 8GB, SSD.</li>
<li>Model B =&gt; 2014 15&quot; MBP 2.2GHZ i7, 16GB, SSD. (<em>This is not the 2015 model but is pretty close to it</em>.)</li>
</ul>
All compilation times are in seconds (s).

    <title>Between an Apple and Despair</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-21-between-apple-and-despair.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The new MBP 15&quot; was just announced and I am #disappointed. No new processor. Just the same one from last year with higher clock rates. No USB type C connectors. No form-factor changes. No “innovation”</p>
<p>I had waited patiently for the last six months for this update. Talk about underwhelmed. I did what any underwhelmed person would do - look for alternatives.</p>
<p>I did find some interesting alternatives in <a href="http://www.dell.com/au/p/alienware-15/pd">Alienware</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/19/msi-gt72-dominator-review">Msi</a>. They were also not constrained by Apple’s release cycles. They could in theory release laptops with the newest processors as soon as they were released. I wanted to run Linux on any laptop I buy. When I did some research around the two options, I came across troubling issues like: “can’t boot to Ubuntu” or “doesn’t have drivers for the wireless card”.</p>
<p>Then it hit me. There was a good reason why I had moved to Apple instead of using my own screamingly fast Linux laptop. I didn’t want to waste my time trying to get the hardware to work with the software. I wanted things to “Just work” - (c)Apple. The Apple, drivers were all there. The software was good-ish. More importantly I knew that if something as basic as a wireless card driver was broken that it would be fixed pretty quick. Not so with Linux and custom hardware.</p>
<p>With Apple I was purchasing the hardware and software, along with an implicit promise that they would work together.</p>
<p>The lack of proper support for Linux from hardware manufacturers is really surprising. Most programmers I know use either Linux or MacOSX. Surely we make up a large percentage of the laptop-buying population? Are Windows developers and gamers the core laptop-buying demographic? Or is it corporate types that love Microsoft Office and other Windows shackles?</p>
<p>If I were given another alternative to using Apple, I would definitely use it. The troubling fact is there are none - if you don’t want to use Windows.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to take the plunge and upgrade my 2010 MBP to the latest 2015 “update”. A friend said I should wait for the new processors coming later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“you are going to be kicking yourself when the new ones come out though”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would mean maybe another six months waiting for an update that would hopefully be worthy of a year of waiting. My only regret is that I hadn’t upgraded six months ago. I would have had a hearty laugh when the current update came out.</p>
<p>And then there’s more interesting news with Intel’s plans for Skylake “leaked” by some so and so. <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/22/rumor-intel-prepping-next-gen-skylake-chips-for-august-debut-may-curtail-broadwell-sales">Skylake is supposed to drop in August</a> and with it bring in a 15% speed increase plus usher in a revolutionary wireless peripheral era. So even if, Intel deliver Skylake in August - and that’s a big “if”, given that they are so behind on Broadwell promises there’s also this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intel’s launching Skylake-S early to take advantage of the buffer zone while taking their time with Skylake-K so that any bugs that hinder clock speed have been ironed out. That would involve solving the TDP problem and eventually rolling out some very impressive unlocked processors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://wccftech.com/intels-broadwell-skylake-uarch-transition-big-prescott-conroe">Read more about that at wccftech</a></p>
<p>So do I want to buy a processor where Intel is trying to iron out its bugs? No thanks. This indicates that the faster Skylake, less “buggy” processors will only start showing up maybe mid 2016. Another reason to buy a MBP now!</p>
<p>So my wait is over. I’m taking the plunge. I hope not to kick myself in August! :)</p>]]></description>

    <title>Know When to Rest</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-17-know-when-to-rest.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s great to a have a routine. It’s great to have goals. It’s great to work consistently day in and day out.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just don’t feel like you have the motivation. Your work feels like a chore. Or that you’ve done all you want to do for the moment. You may have lost your “flow” - where your craft just pours out of you without any provocation.</p>
<p>When this happens, take a break from your routine. You can never produce your best work when your heart is not in it.</p>
<p>Take a day, a week or even a month off. You could even build it into your routine. This time off will help you to revitalise your creative spirit and come back refreshed and renewed to do awesome work.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to break your routine when you need to.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Why I don&apos;t use a Coffee Loyalty Card</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-14-why-i-dont-use-a-loyalty-card.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Loyalty cards. You can’t buy anything these days without being prompted for one. By name they seem to imply some kind of loyalty which I doubt exists.</p>
<p>I have my coffee at an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coffeeanthology">awesome coffee shop</a> everyday. I don’t keep going back because I can get one free coffee for every nine I buy. Quite the contrary. I find getting your loyalty card stamped or lining up your phone with some app to register your purchase quite annoying.</p>
<p>I go there because the coffee is good and it is reasonably priced. If the coffee stops being good or if the price rises exponentially, no amount of “loyalty” is going to get me to go back there.</p>
<p>Also, I like knowing that when I buy my tenth coffee, the owners of the coffee shop, a small business, don’t have to lose some of their profits just to keep me “loyal”.</p>]]></description>

    <title>The Tim Ferriss Show Interviews Matt Mullenweg</title>
    <link>http://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2015-05-13-the-tim-ferriss-show-matt-mullenweg.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Some interesting ideas from <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/02/09/matt-mullenweg">The Tim Ferriss Show’s interview with Matt Mullenweg</a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open source was the most important idea he was exposed to in his lifetime.</li>
<li>Open source is a bill of rights for software. The four freedoms of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can use it for any purpose.</li>
<li>You can deconstruct the software to understand how it works.</li>
<li>You can modify it.</li>
<li>You can distribute your modifications.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The (famous) 5 minute installation of Wordpress. It was not famous, but became so. It did something totally different to the big players in the market.</li>
<li>Philosophy and political science help you to think about systems and incentives.</li>
<li>How do you self-enable people?</li>
<li>If you do X today, what does that result in tomorrow, a year from now, ten years from now?</li>
<li>The dog chasing the car Metaphor. What does the dog do if it catches the car?</li>
<li>Plan for success. What is the natural conclusion of your idea if it’s really successful?</li>
<li>Gives the Wordpress community a nudge to go in directions they would not go by themselves.</li>
<li>Uses Dvorak as an alternative keyboard.</li>
<li>Automattic does not send email. They use <a href="http://p2theme.com">P2</a>. Threads help follow a conversation. How does a new employee follow ten years of email?</li>
<li>Keep information public. Trust people.</li>
<li><a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> is “consumer grade” - it doesn’t suck like most enterprise software.</li>
<li>Rig the game so you can win. Eg. Doing one push-up a day.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
Unschedule more of your life. Create space. Read a lot more to give yourself creative inspiration or the ideas for the next big thing.
</div>
<ol start="15" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The hardest thing is spending time on the most important things in life.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality">Bike shedding</a> - Spending a lot of time on discussions on relatively unimportant but simple issues, while neglecting the more important but complex issues.</li>
<li>Playing Saxophone taught him how to breathe, how to be on stage in front of people, how to listen and respond, how to co-compose on the fly, how to learn new things and how to practice deliberately.</li>
<li>If you only practise the things you are good at you’ll never get better at the things you are not good at.</li>
<li>Business Judo: what can we do that google can’t do?</li>
<li>Advice to his twenty year-old-self: Slow down to go further. Build foundations. Build things that last long term.</li>
<li>Take time for yourself, meditate, focuss on the present moment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="quote">
Everyone is interesting! If you’re bored, the problem is with you not the other person. It’s all about figuring out what someone is into or what they are passionate about.
